# social-platform
Created a GUI-based desktop application using C++ and Qt framework that uses a local repository, based on files, to simulate a Social Platform.
The application starts for every user in the repository, it shows relevant posts based on the subscriptions of the user and allows users to post their status.

Used an [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to keep track of the changes of the program in real time.
